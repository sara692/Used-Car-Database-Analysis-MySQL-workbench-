# Used-Car-Database-Analysis-MySQL-workbench-

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis of a used car dataset using MySQL.
It includes database creation, handling missing data, categorizing mileage, and generating various insights such as price trends, popular models, and seller analysis.

üìÇ Steps & SQL Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Database & Table Creation

'''sql
CREATE DATABASE used_car_db;

USE used_car_db;

CREATE TABLE used_cars (
    listing_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    vin VARCHAR(17),
    make VARCHAR(50),
    model VARCHAR(50),
    year INT,
    trim VARCHAR(50),
    body_type VARCHAR(50),
    fuel_type VARCHAR(30),
    transmission VARCHAR(30),
    mileage INT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    `condition` VARCHAR(30),
    subregion VARCHAR(50),
    region VARCHAR(50),
    country VARCHAR(50),
    seller_type VARCHAR(30)
);
'''
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
Check Missing Data in Each Column
SELECT
    SUM(listing_id IS NULL) AS listing_id_nulls,
    SUM(vin IS NULL OR TRIM(vin) = '') AS vin_missing,
    ...
    SUM(seller_type IS NULL OR TRIM(seller_type) = '') AS seller_type_missing
FROM used_cars;

Retrieve Rows with Any Missing or Empty Values
SELECT *
FROM used_cars
WHERE listing_id IS NULL
   OR vin IS NULL OR TRIM(vin) = ''
   ...
   OR seller_type IS NULL OR TRIM(seller_type) = '';

Replace Null or Empty condition Values with ‚ÄúNot specified‚Äù
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE used_cars
SET `condition` = 'Not specified'
WHERE `condition` IS NULL OR TRIM(`condition`) = '';
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Exploration Queries
1. Average Price by Year, Transmission, Fuel Type, and Country
SELECT year, transmission, fuel_type, country, `condition`,
       AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY year, transmission, fuel_type, country, `condition`
ORDER BY year;

2. Mileage Category Analysis (Using CTE + View)
CREATE VIEW mileage_category_stats AS
WITH mileage_case AS (
    SELECT 
        listing_id, year, mileage, price,
        CASE 
            WHEN mileage < 50000 THEN 'Low'
            WHEN mileage BETWEEN 50000 AND 150000 THEN 'Medium'
            ELSE 'High'
        END AS mileage_category
    FROM used_cars
)
SELECT mileage_category, year,
       COUNT(*) AS total_cars,
       AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM mileage_case
GROUP BY mileage_category, year
ORDER BY mileage_category;

SELECT * FROM mileage_category_stats;

3. Most Common Car Models by Country
SELECT country, model, COUNT(*) AS total_listings
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY country, model
ORDER BY total_listings DESC, country;

4. Price Range by Body Type
SELECT body_type,
       MIN(price) AS min_price,
       MAX(price) AS max_price,
       AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY body_type
ORDER BY avg_price;

5. Price Trend Over Years
SELECT year, AVG(price) AS avg_price, COUNT(*) AS total_cars
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

6. Top 10 Most Expensive Cars
SELECT make, model, year, price, mileage, country
FROM used_cars
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 10;

7. Seller Type Analysis
SELECT seller_type, COUNT(*) AS total_cars, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY seller_type
ORDER BY total_cars DESC;

8. Transmission Preference by Country
SELECT country, transmission, COUNT(*) AS total_cars
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY country, transmission
ORDER BY country, total_cars DESC;

9. Fuel Type Popularity by Region
SELECT region, fuel_type, COUNT(*) AS total_cars, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM used_cars
GROUP BY region, fuel_type
ORDER BY region, total_cars DESC;
